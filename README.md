# Virtual Homelab

This repo will serve as a source of documentation for the steps taken to implement a functional homelab. It will also be used to document the excersises performed once the lab is fully functional.
I began by creating my network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. My lab will consist of a firewall (pfsense), an IDS (SecurityOnion), a domain controller, vulnerable endpoints (vulnhub machines), a Kali Linux machine that will emulate an attacker, and a SOC environment running SPLUNK for detection.
